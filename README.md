üîπ Introduction

The Blog Application is a frontend-based web project that replicates the look and feel of a modern blogging platform. It is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and optionally libraries like TailwindCSS/Bootstrap for styling). The application allows users to explore blog posts, read full articles, and navigate smoothly through different sections. Since this project is frontend-only, all data displayed is static or mock data, and no backend/database is involved.

üîπ Objectives

To create a user-friendly and responsive blog interface.

To showcase how a real-world blog website layout can be built with only frontend technologies.

To practice web design principles, including typography, spacing, responsiveness, and navigation.

To implement sections like homepage, blog listing, article page, and contribute section for a realistic experience.
